/**
 * @brief The mm realloc routine returns a pointer to an allocated region of at least
 * size bytes with the following constraints.
 *      – if ptr is NULL, the call is equivalent to mm malloc(size);
 *      – if size is equal to zero, the call is equivalent to mm free(ptr);
 *      – if ptr is not NULL, it must have been returned by an earlier call to mm malloc or
 *        mm realloc. The call to mm realloc changes the size of the memory block pointed
 *        to by ptr (the old block) to size bytes and returns the address of the new block. Notice
 *        that the address of the new block might be the same as the old block, or it might be
 *        different, depending on your implementation, the amount of internal fragmentation in
 *        the old block, and the size of the realloc request.
 *        The contents of the new block are the same as those of the old ptr block, up to the
 *        minimum of the old and new sizes. Note that the new size may be smaller than the old
 *        size. Everything else is uninitialized. For example, if the old block is 8 bytes and the
 *        new block is 12 bytes, then the first 8 bytes of the new block are identical to the first 8
 *        bytes of the old block and the last 4 bytes are uninitialized. Similarly, if the old block is
 *        8 bytes and the new block is 4 bytes, then the contents of the new block are identical to
 *        the first 4 bytes of the old block.
 * 
 * @param ptr what to be reallocated
 * @param size the new size
